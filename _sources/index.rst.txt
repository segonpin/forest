FOREST (Framework Oriented for Reactor SimulaTions)
====================================================

This project has been built on top of `deal.II <http://www.dealii.org>`_
and has inherited from its philosophy.
It is an extensible code written in C++ to support research in
simulating reactor calculations with the Finite Element Methods.
The library provides well-documented and extensible code base for 
research needs (it is not intended to be used for production
calculations). It is intended to create an open
community providing users and developers with a
state-of-the-art, comprehensive software that performs well while
being simple to extend.
